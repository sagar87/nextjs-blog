LogSeq had a very convenient way import Youtube videos into the database. All you really had to do was to paste the link into a new empty page, et voila, the video would embed into the page. To make notes I would simply use the Helium plugin which enables to scroll the page while keeping the embedded video visible in the app.

Recently, I however switched to Obsidian. There were just too many things in LogSeq that I found really annoying, most importantly it's lack of speed and the _mandatory_ outliner mode. Obsidian is much faster than LogSeq and gives me the freedom to format my writing in any format. Further, it's community has many awesome plugins which I haven't hardly explored yet.

One important task upon switching to Obsidian was to figure out how to take notes from Youtube videos as I am using the resource quite often to learn new things. Obsidian does not support video embeds as easily as LogSeq does, but luckily has the "TimeStamper" plugin which I now use to take notes from Youtube Videos. Before we can use conviniently, we need to set some hotkeys:

I start by creating a new note and then look up the Youtube Url of the video I'd like to take notes for. Next, I paste the link into the novel note. To get the TimeStamp plugin to work, I now select the pasted URL and use the hotkey CMD+SHIFT+Y to "open" the video player. It should now be highlighted in blue. I then start to watch the video and pause the player with CMD+SHIFT+P and insert timstamps with CMD+SHIFT+I. Works like a charm :).
